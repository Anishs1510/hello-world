# hello-world
This is a inital respotiory for learning how to use github and its features and is based on the simple hello world program used to teach programming.
I am currently in 11th grade and will graduate high school as the class of 2019. I then intend to go into either medicine or computer science. I also want to join the marine corps reserves, most likely as an officer, to serve and defend the United States, which I believe to be the greatest nation on the planet.
